# Virtual DOM
In React, **virtual DOM** is a lightweight copy of the DOM. A virtual DOM has the same properties as a real DOM object. 

However, manipulating the DOM is slow. Manipulating the virtual DOM is much faster.

## How It Works
Hereâ€™s what happens when a user opens a website made using React:

* The entire virtual DOM gets updated.
* The virtual DOM gets compared to what it looked like before it was updated. React figures out which elements have changed.
* Only the objects that were changed get updated on the DOM.
* Changes on the DOM cause the screen to change.
