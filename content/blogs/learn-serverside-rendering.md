Server-side rendering (SSR) is a technique used in web development where the server generates the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a webpage and sends it to the client (user's web browser). In contrast to client-side rendering, where the browser loads a basic HTML file and then runs JavaScript to dynamically render the page, SSR provides a pre-rendered page that is immediately visible to the user.

This technique is often used to improve website performance, as pre-rendered pages load faster and are more accessible to search engines. However, it requires more processing power on the server side and may not be suitable for highly dynamic or interactive websites.
