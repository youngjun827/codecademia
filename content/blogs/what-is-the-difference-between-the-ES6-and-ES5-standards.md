ECMAScript (ES) is a standard for programming languages that is widely used for web development. The most recent version of the standard is called ES6 (also known as ECMAScript 2015). Prior to ES6, the previous version of the standard was called ES5 (ECMAScript 5).

# Here are some of the key differences between ES5 and ES6:

1. Syntax: ES6 introduced a number of new syntax features, such as classes, arrow functions, and template literals, which make it easier to write and understand JavaScript code.

2. Modules: ES6 added native support for modules, which are units of code that can be imported and exported in order to share code between files.

3. Promises: ES6 introduced the Promise object, which makes it easier to work with asynchronous code and handle errors.

4. New data types: ES6 introduced new data types such as Map, Set, and Symbol, which can be used to store and manipulate data in new ways.

5. Improved support for object-oriented programming: ES6 added features such as classes, inheritance, and super, which make it easier to write object-oriented code.

Overall, ES6 represents a significant update to the JavaScript language, and many developers consider it to be a more modern and powerful version of the language.
